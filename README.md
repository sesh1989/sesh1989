- 👋 Hi, I’m Sesh
- 👀 I’m interested in C/C++/Java/Python besides Carnatic music, astronomy and modern physics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning vedanta related to my religion
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, but hope to get into something soon (how soon? sorry, unable to fathom)
- 📫 How to reach me? This forum should have something for this.
